Subject: [PATCH 117/158] arm64: dts: ipq8074: add APCS node

APCS now has support for providing the APSS clocks as the child device
for IPQ8074.

So, add the required DT node for it as it will later be used as the CPU
clocksource.

Signed-off-by: Robert Marko <robimarko@gmail.com>

Changes in v3:
* Node does not currently exist in the upstream kernel, so add it instead
of modifying.
