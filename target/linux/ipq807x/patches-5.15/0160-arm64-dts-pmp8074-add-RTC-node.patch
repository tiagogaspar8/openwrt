Subject: [PATCH 160/162] arm64: dts: pmp8074: add RTC node

PMP8074 has a PM8941 compatible RTC, so add the required DT node for it.

It is left disabled by default as PMIC itself has no built-in battery
backup and thus losing power means losing time, so allow boards that
have the optional battery backup connected to enable the RTC.
