Subject: [PATCH 127/158] drivers: thermal: tsens: allow configuring min and
 max trips

IPQ8074 and IPQ6018 dont support negative trip temperatures and support
up to 204 degrees C as the max trip temperature.

So, instead of always setting the -40 as min and 120 degrees C as max
allow it to be configured as part of the features.
